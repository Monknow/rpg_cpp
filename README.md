# Combat Simulator C++

To compile and run the code, you can execute the `run.bat` file.

Once there, you can choose a character among four different types:

1.  Bard
2.  Knight
3.  Mage
4.  Ranger

You can also choose a name.

Once that's done, on each turn you battle a random enemy! You can choose between a basic attack with lower damage, and a powerful attack with higher damage but with limited attempts.
